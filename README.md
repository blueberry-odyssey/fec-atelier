  Ratings & Reviews: This feature contains the average rating for the selected product, with detailed breakdown of how many star ratings it received, as well as ratings on characteristics of the product (i.e. size, length, quality, comfort, etc.). In addition, there is a list of reviews that can be sorted based on relevance, helpfulness, or newest. The user can select one of the options to sort the listed reviews based on their choosing. Some reviews will contain image thumbnails, which can be clicked on for an expanded view that opens up in a modal window. Each individual review can be interacted in two ways: to mark the review as helpful, or to report the review. These can only be clicked on once. Lastly, one can submit a review by clicking on the Add a Review button, which will open a modal window with a form to rate the product details, and an optional image uploader if the user wishes to do so. Clicking on the submit button will automatically close the modal window and back to the original page.
